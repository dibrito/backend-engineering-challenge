### CPU Benchmark Comparison after bug fix

| Metric        | cpufifo.bench | cpubufffifo.bench |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **sec/op**    | 23.94m ± 1%   | 24.70m ± 10%      |
| **B/op**      | 38.20Mi ± 0%  | 32.17Mi ± 0%      |
| **allocs/op** | 30.73k ± 1%   | 2.932k ± 1%       |

### Memory Benchmark Comparison

| Metric        | memfifo.bench | membufffifo.bench |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **sec/op**    | 23.69m ± 1%   | 24.65m ± 3%       |
| **B/op**      | 38.20Mi ± 0%  | 32.17Mi ± 0%      |
| **allocs/op** | 30.75k ± 0%   | 2.930k ± 0%       |

### Analysis

After the fix, the Buff FIFO implementation (`cpubufffifo.bench` and `membufffifo.bench`) shows the following results compared to the standard FIFO implementation:

1. **sec/op**:
   - **CPU Bench**: `cpubufffifo.bench` is slightly slower (24.70m vs. 23.94m).
   - **Memory Bench**: `membufffifo.bench` is also slightly slower (24.65m vs. 23.69m).

2. **B/op**:
   - In both CPU and memory benchmarks, Buff FIFO uses significantly less memory (`32.17Mi` vs. `38.20Mi`).

3. **allocs/op**:
   - Buff FIFO has a dramatically lower number of allocations per operation (`2.932k` vs. `30.73k` for CPU, `2.930k` vs. `30.75k` for memory).

### Conclusion

While the **Buff FIFO** is slightly **slower** in terms of **execution time**, it is much more efficient in terms of memory usage and the number of allocations.

**Buff FIFO** implementation is **better** optimized for **MEMORY** efficiency and could be better solution for applications/situations where memory usage is a critical factor.

If the primary concern is **SPEED**, the **standard FIFO** implementation might still be preferable.
